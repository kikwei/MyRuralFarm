        <p class="text-center" id="aboutUs">Agriculture contributes to over 40% of Kenya`s GDP and hence it forms the backbone of the economy. For many years, Kenyans have been practicing subsistence farming with only a small fraction doing agribusiness. Traditional farming, climate change and increased rural-urban migration are some of the factors contributing to the current national food insecurity in Kenya. Many Kenyans mostly living in urban areas would like to invest in agriculture but they lack the approach due to; geographical immobility of land, difficulties in farm investment management, lack of access to the right technologies , lack of on-site consultation, as well as market unavailability and fluctuations.</p>
